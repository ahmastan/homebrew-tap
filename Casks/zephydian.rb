  caveats <<~EOS
    Zephydian isn't signed with an Apple Developer ID yet, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    To open it, try once, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".

    Features you switch on may ask for macOS permissions such as Accessibility. Until Zephydian is
    signed, macOS can forget them after an update: use Settings > Permissions > Repair in Zephydian.
